# Mystery Planet

An exoplanet or extrasolar planet, is any planet beyond our solar system. Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small region of the Milky Way. 
NASAâ€™s Kepler Space Telescope is responsible for finding over 2700 confirmed exoplanets.

Most exoplanets are found through indirect methods: measuring the dimming of a star that happens to have a planet pass in front of it, called the transit 
method, or monitoring the spectrum of a star for the tell-tale signs of a planet pulling on its star and causing its light to subtly Doppler shift.

This dataset describes the change in the flux(intensity of light) for over 5000 stars. Each star is assigned a binary label 2
and 1 (where 2 - shows that confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting the star)
